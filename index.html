                <p>Hello, my name is Thijmen, I am 17 years old. I study software developer, currently year 2, at the ROC van Twente located 
                   in Enschede. With this education I have learned the basics of; C#, HTML and CSS, I am also learning how to make small Unity 
                   games/ projects. With all the knowledge I have acquired, from the lessons to the projects I have completed, I can use it in the workplace. 
                   An example is that I have already worked a lot in teamwork, this is very important in this field of work. </p>

                <p2>Quantum Rush:</p2>
                <p3>A school project that I created together with a small group of classmates. This game had to be a MicroGame/ Phone game,
                    so we made a game based on Subway Surfers. Quantum Rush is set in a futuristic cyberpunk theme and you run through a city 
                    with neon lights. It is a endless runner in which you have to avoid various obstacles to stay alive. On the way you can pick
                    up coins, the goal is to pick up as much coins that you can and all coins you picked up will be saved. The intention for 
                    the entire project was to also include powerups, this was not possible due to lack of time.
                </p3>
                <p4>
                    We worked as a group with the SCRUM method and a Code of Conduct, this had to be observed by all group members.
                </p4>
                <p4>
                    I have worked on the designs of all the menu's, I put music over the whole game and in the settings menu you can higher or
                    lower the volume. You can pause the game and there is a game over screen. One of the requirements for the project were saving 
                    data using Javascript, I used it to save the coins you picked up while playing the game. I also helped with debugging various 
                    problems that my group members encountered.
                </p4>
                <p4>
                    we also had to make a promotional video for this project, you can watch it on the left side of the screen. On the right side 
                    of the screen you can see the 3 softwares we used the most.
                </p4>
