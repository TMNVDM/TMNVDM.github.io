            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Thijmen, I am 17 years old. I study software developer, currently year 2, at the ROC
                van Twente located
                in Enschede. With this education I have learned the basics of; C#, HTML and CSS, I am also learning how
                to make small Unity
                games/ projects. With all the knowledge I have acquired, from the lessons to the projects I have
                completed, I can use it in the workplace.
                An example is that I have already worked a lot in teamwork, this is very important in this field of
                work.

            <h4>Projects:</h4>
            <p>Quantum Rush:
                A school project that I created together with a small group of classmates. This game had to be a
                MicroGame/ Phone game, so we made a game based on Subway Surfers. Quantum Rush is set in a futuristic
                cyberpunk theme and you run through a city with neon lights. It is a endless runner in which you have to
                avoid various obstacles to stay alive. On the way you can pick up coins, the goal is to pick up as much
                coins that you can and all coins you picked up will be saved. The intention for the entire project was
                to also include powerups, this was not possible due to lack of time.
                We worked as a group with the SCRUM method and a Code of Conduct, this had to be observed by all group
                members.
                I have worked on the designs of all the menu's, I put music over the whole game and in the settings menu
                you can higher or lower the volume. You can pause the game and there is a game over screen. One of the
                requirements for the project were saving data using Javascript, I used it to save the coins you picked
                up while playing the game. I also helped with debugging various problems that my group members
                encountered.
                we also had to make a promotional video for this project, you can watch it on the left side of the
                screen. On the right side of the screen you can see the 3 softwares we used the most.</p>
